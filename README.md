## Files
1.py - Reading the data band making it suitable for ML  
2.py - Splitting the data 80:20 for training and testing the model  
3.py - Evaluating the best models using K-Fold Cross-Validation  
4.py - Testing the passing models  
5.py - Building robust classifier by combining all models on the whole dataset  
final.py - Creating a function that can take symptoms as input and generate predictions for disease
